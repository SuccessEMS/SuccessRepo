        <p>Your EMS administrator can configure notification rules to alert you or groups of which you are a member when additions or modifications have been carried out in the EMS database, such as the creation or modification of a booking, the creation or modification of a service order, the creation of a new web account, and so on.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When the Notifications tab&#160;first&#160;opens, all the notification rules that include you are listed in the Notification Rule pane (upper left pane) of the tab. Next to each rule, the number of&#160;newnotifications (notifications with the current day’s date) is displayed. The tab is interactive. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a rule to view all unreviewed notifications for future bookings.</li>
            <li>Select a rule, and under Show, select Reviewed to view all reviewed notifications for future bookings.</li>
            <li>Select a rule, and under Show, select Old to view all notifications for past bookings.</li>
            <li>Select a notification to view detailed information about the notification (such as new bookings, the changes made to a booking, and the users who were notified of the changes) in a pane at the bottom of the window.</li>
            <li>Select Show New Only to show only new notifications (notifications with the current day’s date) for the notification rules.</li>
            <li>Select a notification, and then click Reviewed to mark a notification as “Reviewed.”</li>
            <li>Select a notification and then click Go To to open the item to which the notification refers.</li>
            <li>If the notification is attached to a reservation, booking, or booking detail, then the reservation opens in the Navigator, and the appropriate folder (Reservation, Booking, or Booking Detail) is automatically selected.</li>
            <li>If the notification is attached to a group, then the Group window opens with the group information displayed in the window.</li>
            <li>Click Refresh to check for notifications that have been issued since you opened the Dashboard.</li>
            <li>Select a notification, or CTRL-click to select multiple notifications, and then click Delete to delete the notifications from the Notifications tab.</li>
