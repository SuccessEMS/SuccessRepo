        <p>What's the difference between a "reservation" and a "booking?"&#160;A&#160;<strong>Reservation</strong>&#160;consists&#160;of one&#160;or more <strong>Bookings.</strong> That's it.</p>
        <p>Every booking belongs to a reservation. EMS lets you have&#160;multiple bookings under a single reservation. When you have multiple bookings in a reservation, each booking&#160;can be independent of the other, such as reserving a set of rooms for an event, or can be a series of bookings under a <strong>Recurring </strong>reservation.</p>
        <p>Each booking can contain&#160;multiple <strong>Booking Details</strong>, which are the resources and services required to support the booking (such as catering and room setup).</p>

        <p>A <em>reservation</em> is the "who and what" of an event. For example, the Academic Planning Board&#160;(the who) may reserve space for a Semester Kickoff&#160;event&#160;(the what).&#160;</p>
        <h4>Bookings: Where and When</h4>
        <p>A <em>booking</em> is the "where and when" of an event. For example, the Academic Planning Board schedules the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday in January (the when). The Academic Planning Board&#160;now has a single reservation with a single booking in {{product}}. If, however, they schedule&#160;the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday of each month for a year (the when), then the board now has a single reservation with 12 bookings.</p>

        <p>A booking can have one or more booking details associated with it. <em>Booking details</em> are the resources (items for the meeting)&#160;or services (people and their activities)&#160;that are needed for an event, the notes for the event, the activities for the event, the room charges for the event, or any combination of these. For example, for the Academic Planning Board's staff meeting, the resources could&#160;include catering (coffee service, bagels and muffins, and so on) and A/V equipment, plus the services of&#160;a person bringing in and setting up a projector, moving&#160;a speaker's podium, and so on). &#160;</p>
        <h6>Service Orders</h6>
        <p>System Administrators configure "buckets" of these details as "Categories," which streamlines the process of adding details to bookings.&#160;</p>
