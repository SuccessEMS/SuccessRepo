        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Copy a Reservation in the Navigator</h1>
        <p class="Body">An easy way for you to make a new reservation in the Navigator is to copy an existing reservation and then make any necessary changes to the reservation. When you copy an existing reservation, you must provide a new start date and a new status; however, you can copy the existing reservation reminders, comments, user-defined fields, and drawings as is, and you can copy one or more or all the existing booking details.</p>
