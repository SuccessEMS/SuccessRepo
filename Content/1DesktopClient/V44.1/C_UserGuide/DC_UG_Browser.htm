        <h1>The Browser</h1>
        <p>You can use the Browser to search at a very detailed level&#160;for reservations, bookings, service orders, resources, everyday user reservations, and pre-defined queries. The results are listed in a calendar view. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Using the Browser, you can perform&#160;a&#160;basic search&#160;or an&#160;advanced search:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>In a&#160;basic search, you specify basic information for a reservation when you first create it, such as the starting time, the end time, the group for which the event was scheduled, the group contact name, and so on.</li>
            <li>An&#160;advanced search&#160;is a field-level search that is carried out at the reservation level, the booking level, the booking detail level, the booking detail item level, or any combination of these. For example, in an advanced search, you can specify criteria as granular as who added a specific booking detail item.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To search using the Browser, see <a href="DC_UG_SearchwithBrowser.html">Search with the Browser</a>.</p>

                <p>The Everyday User Reservations searching tool&#160;is identical to the Browser searching tool with one exception: when the Browser opens for the first time, the&#160;Browse For&#160;function is set to all Reservations in your organization's database, whereas the Everyday User Reservation tool is set to show only Everyday User Reservations. Basically, although this section is written from the perspective of using the Browser, all the information can be applied when using the Everyday User Reservation searching tool. </p>
