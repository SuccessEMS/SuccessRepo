        <h1>The Reservation Wizard</h1>
        <p>You can use the Reservation Wizard to check for available space for an event and to make a reservation for the event. The Reservation Wizard helps you search for rooms that are available for a particular time on one day (a simple reservation with one booking) or on multiple days (a series reservation with multiple bookings). You can also create a series reservation by selecting one date and time, but multiple rooms.</p>
