        <p>Your Administrator can automate alerts&#160;to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in EMS for bookings and reservations,&#160;service orders, room types,&#160;setup types,&#160;user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these&#160;notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Be sure to review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.&#160;</p>

        <p>If your organization deploys our Integration to MicrosoftÂ® Exchange, you can view the availability of meeting rooms and attendees, and send MicrosoftÂ® OutlookÂ® meeting invitations, all from within EMS Web App.</p>
        <p>You must be licensed for EMS Desktop Client, EMS Web App, and Integration to MicrosoftÂ® Exchange in order to configure and use this capability. If you are unsure if your organization is licensed for Integration to MicrosoftÂ® Exchange, or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your EMS Account Executive.</p>

        <p>When the Notifications tab&#160;first&#160;opens, all the notification rules that include you are listed in the Notification Rule pane (upper left pane) of the tab. Next to each rule, the number of&#160;new notifications (notifications with the current dayâ€™s date) is displayed.</p>

            <li>Select a notification and then click&#160;Go To&#160;to open the item to which the notification refers.</li>
            <li>If the notification is attached to a reservation, booking, or booking detail, then the reservation opens in the Navigator, and the appropriate folder (Reservation, Booking, or Booking Detail) is automatically selected.</li>
            <li>If the notification is attached to a group, then the Group window opens with the group information displayed in the window.</li>
            <li>Click&#160;Refresh&#160;to check for notifications that have been issued since you opened the Dashboard.</li>
            <li>Select a notification, or CTRL-click to select multiple notifications, and then click&#160;Delete&#160;to delete the notifications from the Notifications tab.</li>
