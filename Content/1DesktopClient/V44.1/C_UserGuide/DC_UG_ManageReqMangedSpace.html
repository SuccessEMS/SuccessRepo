        <h1>Manage Requests for Managed Space</h1>
        <p>This topic guides you in approving "pending requests," which are requests for space that require supervisory approval and appear in your Dashboard.&#160;</p>

                <p>Once your system administrator has&#160;<a href="../B_ConfigGuide/DesktopClient_ConfigFacil.html" title="Configuration &gt; Facilities" alt="Configuration &gt; Facilities">configured facilities</a>&#160;(rooms, categories, services, resources, and so on), he or she can configure special process templates for "managed space," which is meeting space that may require additional oversight and an approval process to finalize a reservation. For example, your organization may need specialized space like the President's Conference room, or a large banquet hall, to be treated&#160;as managed space to ensure that any request to use it is approved by a supervisor.&#160;Typically, managed space involves services, expenses, and invoicing that affect&#160;multiple stakeholders and departments, and templates designed for this model are typically assigned to Everyday Users of EMS Web App. By contrast, such templates are&#160;not&#160;available for EMS for Outlook&#160;users since Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Outlook does not show the&#160;request status&#160;of such a reservation.&#160;</p>
