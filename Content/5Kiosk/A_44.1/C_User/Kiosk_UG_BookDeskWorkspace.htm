        <h1>Book a Desk or Workspace in EMS Kiosk App</h1>
        <p>The&#160;<span class="bold">Make a Reservation</span>&#160;page in EMS Kiosk App allows you to make your own reservations for today.</p>
        <p>Note:&#160;The following procedure is written from the perspective of a group search; however, depending on how your EMS Kiosk App&#160;is configured, you might be required to enter a personnel number/employee ID number for your search criteria.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click&#160;<span class="bold">Make a Reservation</span>.&#160;A page opens where you find your user profile in the system (unless your system is set up to allow guest reservations).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Group/Person Search Page</p>

        </p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>In the&#160;Group&#160;field (which may be labeled anything your Administrator prefers, such as "Employee"), enter your name, and then click&#160;<span class="bold">Search</span>.&#160;A list of all groups/people that meet your search criteria is displayed. The search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string, but the string can be found anywhere in the search results, and it is not case-sensitive. For example, a search string of “ed” returns both Anderson, Scott and Evans,&#160;Dean.</li>
