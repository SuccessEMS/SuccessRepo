        <p class="Body">In EMS&#160;Master Calendar, as the site administrator, you have the option of setting up event types and holidays (special dates) from “scratch;” however, if you are an existing EMS customer who uses one of the EMS products, such as Campus, Desktop Client, Enterprise, Professional, Legal, and so on, this means that you have already configured this information for your EMS application. Rather than creating these items from scratch, if your organization has purchased the optional module, Master Calendar Data Connectors, you can follow the steps in this topic&#160;to perform a one-time import of event types and holidays from your EMS application into Master Calendar. You can import event types and holidays from one or more EMS databases to one or more calendars in Master Calendar. Also, at the data source level, you can select a high-level view of your user-defined fields (UDFs) in your EMS database, and you can then run a connector to import one or more selected UDFs and their associated answers into your Master Calendar database. Managing data sources in Master Calendar consists of adding data sources, deleting data sources, importing the event types, importing the holidays, and selecting the UDFs that are to be imported. You can also view the history of event type mapping between your EMS database and your Master Calendar database.</p>
