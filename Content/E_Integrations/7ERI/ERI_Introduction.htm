        <h1>Introduction to Exchange Room Integration (ERI)</h1>
        <h2>What Is ERI?</h2>
        <p>Exchange Room Integration (ERI) is a simplified integration tool that allows clients to utilize their EMS software to its fullest potential. ERI allows enhanced integration of resources and technology during the EMS booking process for managed spaces. Exchange Room Integration simplifies the booking process and provides a cohesive and powerful way to book and manage resources. EMS Exchange Room Integration will take your resource scheduling to the next level.</p>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows integration of third-party technology (e.g., videoconference device or display panels) to a booking in EMS by linking to a Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange resource mailbox.</li>
            <li>Automatically includes fixed-room resources in the room booking (e.g., collaboration devices) through the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange resource mailboxes.</li>
            <li>Allows integration of non-fixed resources (e.g., Mobile Microsoft Surface Hubs) during the booking process.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How ERI Works</h2>
        <p>Once an everyday user adds a technology/resource to a booking using EMS for Outlook, EMS Web App, or the EMS Mobile App, ERI will seamlessly integrate the resource to the booking through the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange resource (room/equipment) mailbox. With EMS Exchange Room Integration (ERI), allows users to book in-room resource technologies seamlessly.</p>
