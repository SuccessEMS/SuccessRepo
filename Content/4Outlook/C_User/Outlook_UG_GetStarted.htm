        <h1>Get Started with EMS for Outlook</h1>
        <p>Important:&#160;EMS for Outlook is currently only available for Windows Outlook. It is not compatible with Outlook Online or for Mac.</p>
        <p>EMS for Outlook is an optional add-on for Microsoft<sup>®</sup>&#160;Outlook; if you have it installed, you will see the EMS for Outlook icon in the top toolbar of your Outlook application window. This tool&#160;enables you to easily use Outlook&#160;to search for available rooms&#160;throughout your EMS database&#160;and make a reservation without exiting the application. Once you begin a meeting in Microsoft<sup>®</sup>&#160;Outlook, you can access the add-in by clicking the EMS icon.&#160;You can search for room availability for a particular time on one day (a simple reservation with one booking) or on multiple days (a series reservation with multiple bookings).</p>
