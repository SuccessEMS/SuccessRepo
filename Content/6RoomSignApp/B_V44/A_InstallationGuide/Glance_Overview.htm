        <p>EMS Glance is an optional web-based application that turns your tablet into a digital room sign. Mounted outside of a meeting room or workspace in landscape orientation, the application indicates whether a space is available or in use. The application also provides functionality to check-in, end, extend and book new meetings.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT:  Please note that your EMS Glance purchase only includes the software application itself; not the device, mounting accessories (enclosures, power supplies, etc.) or physical installation.</p>
        <p>The EMS Glance solution is comprised of four main components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">EMS Glance Device</span>: Device with a supported browser installed that will be accessing the EMS Glance web application. A particular device is tied to one specific room in EMS.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">EMS Glance Web Application</span>: EMS Glance web application</li>
            <li><span class="bold">EMS Glance Web Service API</span>: Web service API that manages all communication between the EMS Glance web application and your EMS database.</li>
