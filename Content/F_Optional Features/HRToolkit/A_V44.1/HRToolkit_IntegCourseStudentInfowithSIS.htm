        <h1>Integrate Course and Student Information with Student Information Systems (SIS)</h1>
        <p>EMS integrates with most commercial and many custom SIS/ERP systems, saving your institution time and eliminating data entry duplication. The optional EMS Campus Web Service provides bi-directional integration so that course data and instructor information is pulled into EMS, and rooms assigned in EMS are then written back to the SIS. With SIS integration, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pull course and instructor information from the SIS to create multiple scheduling scenarios.</li>
            <li>Quickly publish selected scheduling scenarios for students and instructors to view.</li>
            <li>Allow departments to collaborate online for a paperless planning process.</li>
            <li>Easily identify all new data moved into EMS for review.</li>
            <li>Report on seat fill percentage, time block availability, utilization trends, and more.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Supported SIS</h2>
        <p>You can manually or automatically synchronize your campus-specific SIS data (Instructors, Course Types, Subjects, and Terms) with EMS using the following supported SIS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ellucian’s Banner</li>
            <li>Ellucian’s Colleague (on SQL or Oracle platform)</li>
            <li>Ellucian’s PowerCampus</li>
            <li>Oracle’s Peoplesoft</li>
            <li>Jenzabar CX and EX</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: Non-SIS customers can still streamline data entry by importing tab-delimited lists of people/groups, rooms, resources, reservations, and (for EMS Campus), final exam schedules.
