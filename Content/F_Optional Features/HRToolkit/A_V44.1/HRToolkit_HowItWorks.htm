        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>The&#160;<span class="italics">EMS_Staging</span>&#160;database (created <span class="bold">by&#160;HRTK Staging DB Install G_GT_WU.sql</span>) is used to stage User records before they are imported into EMS.&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: Your EMS database may have the <span class="italics">Groups </span>field renamed to another term, such as&#160;<span class="italics">Employees</span>.</p>
        <p>Once you have identified the data source within your organization that will be used to create and maintain your User records, you will then define and create a process to import active&#160;User records into the&#160;<span class="italics">tblPeople&#160;</span>table within&#160;<span class="italics">EMS_Staging</span>&#160;(shown below).</p>
