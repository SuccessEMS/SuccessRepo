        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The EMS Integration to RoomWizard is an optional module for communicating room reservation information between EMS and&#160;<a href="https://www.steelcase.com/products/scheduling-systems/roomwizard/" title="https://www.steelcase.com/products/scheduling-systems/roomwizard/">Steelcase RoomWizard</a>. A RoomWizard is a wall-mounted unit that is associated with a particular room and used to schedule and view events in it.</p>
        <h2>How it Works&#160;</h2>
        <p>Once a connection has been established between a specific unit and an EMS database, EMS booking information is automatically displayed on the RoomWizard device for that room.&#160;In addition, new impromptu meetings and adjustments to existing meetings made directly on a RoomWizard unit are automatically relayed to the EMS database.&#160;</p>
        <h2>How Do I Install It?&#160;</h2>
