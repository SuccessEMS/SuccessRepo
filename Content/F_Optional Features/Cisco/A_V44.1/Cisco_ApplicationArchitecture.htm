        <h1>Application Architecture</h1>
        <p>The EMS – Cisco TMS Interface is comprised of two components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">EMS – Cisco TMS Service</span>&#160;– Windows service responsible for pushing video&#160;conference bookings from EMS to the Cisco TMS Booking API at timed intervals.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Cisco TMS Activity DLL</span>&#160;– Custom Cisco TMS DLL provided by EMS that will display all EMS – Cisco TMS Interface activity within the EMS application including errors and successfully scheduled video&#160;conferences.&#160;The Cisco TMS Activity DLL also contains an area that allows EMS Administrators to configure various EMS – Cisco TMS Interface settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>New video&#160;conferences booked in EMS are pushed to the Cisco TMS Booking API based on various settings defined within EMS. Subsequent critical booking changes (i.e. date, time or location changes) and/or cancellations are also relayed to the API.&#160;</p>

        <p>Tip:&#160;The EMS – Cisco TMS Interface is a one-way interface and changes made in Cisco TMS will&#160;not&#160;be reflected in EMS.
