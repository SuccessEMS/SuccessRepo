        <h1>EMS Mobile App</h1>
        <p>EMS Mobile App, available on iOS and Android smartphones, is designed primarily for everyday users "on the go." It allows users to make simple reservations in unmanaged spaces (i.e., spaces without services and approvals), such as workspaces and open conference rooms.</p>
        <p>The EMS&#160;Mobile App is designed specifically for smartphones. It offers functionality specifically for everyday users who need access to EMS while they're on the go. The EMS Mobile App also runs on tablets that run iOS or Android, but the screen layout is optimized for smartphones and does not take advantage of larger displays.</p>
        <p>From this section, you can explore Installation, Configuration, and User guides, as well as Release Notes and video tutorials.</p>
