        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> (V44.1) Installation Guide</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" />&#160;is an optional&#160;web application to access online. <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> lets you see your schedule, create new reservations, and change existing reservations.</p>
        <p>If you have deployed an older version of <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> and are upgrading to the newest version, please encourage users at your facility to review {see What's New}&#160;before they begin working with the new version of the software. Doing so will streamline the adoption of&#160;the new release and help your users benefit from new features and functions that they might not otherwise discover.</p>
        <p>Concept: The EMS Web App also runs on a mobile device such as a tablet or handheld. Due to the smaller screen size and resolution of tablets and smartphones, pages may display differently but most of the same functionality is still available.</p>
        <p>EMS Mobile App, by contrast, is an app designed specifically for smartphones. It offers functionality specifically for everyday users who need access to EMS while they're on the go. The EMS Mobile App also runs on tablets that run iOS or Android, but the screen layout is optimized for smartphones and does not take advantage of larger displays.</p>
