        <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction to the EMS&#160;Web App</h2>
        <p>The EMS Web App is a browser-based interface to EMS that helps you to find and book an available workspace as well as schedule and manage meetings, events, services, and more.</p>
        <p>With the Web App (formerly known as Virtual EMS), you can empower your employees to self-serve for specific meeting or work spaces or give them the ability to request reservations for managed spaces. </p>
        <p>Concept: The EMS Web App also runs on a mobile device such as a tablet or handheld. Due to the smaller screen size and resolution of tablets and smartphones, pages may display differently but most of the same functionality is still available.</p>
        <p>EMS Mobile App, by contrast, is an app designed specifically for smartphones. It offers functionality specifically for everyday users who need access to EMS while they're on the go. The EMS Mobile App also runs on tablets that run iOS or Android, but the screen layout is optimized for smartphones and does not take advantage of larger displays.</p>
        <h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation Requirements</h2>
        <p>Before beginning the installation process, please install or upgrade your EMS databases as outlined in the EMS Web App Installation Instructions.</p>
        <p>Installation will prompt you to enter a web server. Special setup guides are available for Windows 2008/2008 R2 Web Server and Windows 2012/2012 R2 Web Server.</p>
        <p>Existing versions of EMS Web App must be manually uninstalled. Please make sure to copy-off and save any files that have been customized.</p>
        <p>Please review the System Requirements for V44.1 here. </p>
        <h2><a name="Upgrade"></a>Upgrade Considerations</h2>
        <p>If you have deployed an older version of EMS Web App and are upgrading to the newest version, please encourage users at your facility to review What's New before they begin working with the new version of the software. Doing so will streamline the adoption of the new release and help your users benefit from new features and functions that they might not otherwise discover. Please see Upgrade Considerations for more information.</p>
