        <p>Note: For a conceptual overview, be sure to review the following see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reservations, Bookings, and Booking Details</li>
            <li>Reservation and Bookings Structure</li>

            <li>Booking Templates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can begin making a reservation by clicking the CREATE A RESERVATION option (on the left menu) or the&#160;<span class="bold">Book&#160;Now</span> button next to one of your reservation templates (on the right).</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Next, the Create a Reservation screen appears, where EMS Web App&#160;will lead you through the reservation process.&#160;Enter information&#160;(including all required fields) , using the&#160;<span class="bold">Next&#160;Step</span> button to advance through the process.&#160;</p>

        <h2><a name="Specify_When_and_Where"></a>Specify When and Where&#160;</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>To specify&#160;<span class="bold">When</span>, select&#160;dates, times, recurrence (optional), and time&#160;zone for the reservation in the upper left panel.</li>
            <li>To specify&#160;<span class="bold">Where</span>, in lower left panel, select one of the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Let Me&#160;Search for a&#160;Room</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">I Know What Room I Want</span>&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: Filters in this lower left panel help you narrow your Room Search Results. When you click <span class="bold">Search</span>, results appear on the right. From these results, you can view expanded Room Details by clicking on the room name.</p>
        <p>Locating space as part of the reservation process is different than browsing locations.  See Also: <MadCap:xref href="WebApp_SearchingforAvailableRooms.html">Search for Available Rooms</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Tip: Once you have established favorites, EMS Web App uses these (plus the parameters of the booking template in use) to filter your search results when you use the <span class="bold">Let Me Search For A Room</span> option. To expand your search results beyond your favorites, de-select the Favorite rooms only checkbox or click <span class="bold">Add/Remove</span>  next to <span class="bold">Locations</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/WebApp_User/Making a Reservation in the_1.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Once you have located a room to reserve, click the&#160;Add&#160;icon to add&#160;the booking to your cart. You can delete or change the room before finalizing your Reservation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;If you are booking video conferences or multiple rooms,&#160;see <MadCap:xref href="WebApp_BookingVCRoom.html">Book a Video Conference Room</MadCap:xref>&#160;and&#160;<MadCap:xref href="WebApp_BookingMultipleRooms.html">Book Multiple Rooms</MadCap:xref>.&#160;Then, skip to Step 7.</p>
        <h2><a name="Specify_Who_and_What"></a>Specify Who and What&#160;</h2>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>In the Attendees&#160;area&#160;(near the center of the screen), specify headcount and attendees.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>​<img src="Images/WebApp_User/Making a Reservation in the_2.png"></img></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your organization uses EMS for Outlook, you will use the Attendees section to&#160;add or remove attendees and send them invitations or notifications. Attendees can be individuals,&#160;mailing lists or groups. To see who is in a mailing list or group,&#160;expand it.&#160;This&#160;feature lets&#160;you&#160;view attendees' availability and add or subtract them from the event.</li>
            <li>If your organization does not use EMS for Outlook, you will see a list of EMS Web App users and groups, but you do&#160;not&#160;see a&#160;calendar grid showing their availability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Concept: Adding attendees to an event is different than browsing people. For detailed instructions on using the BROWSE PEOPLE option from the main menu.

Should this link go to the &quot;Locate People&quot; topics?" MadCap:editor="Megan.Laub" MadCap:editDate="2017-11-22T14:12:20.5707711-07:00">Searching for People</MadCap:annotation>.</p>
        <p>Tip: If available, select a <span class="bold">Setup Type</span> (if available) for the reservation; this associates likely services and features with bookings.</p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Once you&#160;complete&#160;all required fields on this tab, click&#160;<span class="bold">Next&#160;Step</span> in the upper right corner.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Choose Services​ (Optional)&#160;</h3>
        <p>Concept: Choose Services is an optional feature based on the booking template you use. Services include room setup and teardown, equipment, and any other services you wish to associate with a room. Your Administrator sets which services can be associated with a room and with an event type.</p>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Under the&#160;<span class="bold">Services&#160;</span>tab in the Create Reservation screen, specify any services you wish to associate with the reservation (if available, you can&#160;click&#160;<span class="bold">Skip Services</span>). The example below showing a workspace booking&#160;may differ from your administrator settings, such as catering options and billing.</li>
        </ol>

            </img>

        <ol start="7">
            <li>When complete, click&#160;<span class="bold">Next&#160;Step</span> in the upper right corner.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Add Reservation Details&#160;</h3>
        <p>The Reservation Details screen finalizes information about your reservation. Invitations to bookings and attachments will be sent to all attendees.&#160;The example shown below may differ from your implementation. For an in-depth overview of this part of the booking process,&#160;See Also:&#160;<MadCap:xref href="WebApp_AddingReservationDetails.htm">Add Reservation Details</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol start="8">
            <li>Complete all required information. Then click&#160;<span class="bold">Save Reservation Details</span> and <span class="bold">Create Reservation</span>.</li>
        </ol>

            <img src="Images/WebApp_User/Making a Reservation in the_5.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/3914/resdetailslong.png?revision=2">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Tip: To add the reservation to your Outlook calendar, click the <span class="bold">Add this reservation to my calendar</span> checkbox at the bottom of the window.</p>
        <h3>EMS for Outlook® (Optional Capability)</h3>
        <p>Concept: EMS for Outlook® is an optional (extra cost) purchase. If your organization has purchased it, then you will see the EMS plugin icon in your Outlook application. You will also see additional features and functionality in EMS. Further, anywhere that you see people or groups in EMS, you will have access to everyone in your organization's email database (which is stored in Exchange Server). This means that you can see people's availability (Out of Office, Busy, In a Meeting, etc.), send them email invitations or notices, and add EMS events to your Outlook calendar.</p>
