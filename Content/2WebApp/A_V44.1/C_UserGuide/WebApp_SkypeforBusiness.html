        <h1>Skype for Business in the EMS Web App</h1>
        <p>Everyday Users can now integrate audio/video conferencing tools with EMS applications, starting with Skype for Business. It will no longer be necessary for users to simultaneously create a separate meeting to enable an audio/video conferencing component to their meetings. The EMS integration of Skype for Business allows users to easily integrate instant messaging and audio/video conferencing to their meetings without the need for A/V support.&#160;</p>
        <p>Important: Skype for Business is ONLY available on Exchange-enabled templates. Users cannot edit or remove Skype for Business meetings from their reservations. Users can delete the link but the <span class="bold">Join </span>link will remain enabled. For more information about Configuring Skype for Business, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../13Skype/C_UserGuide/SkypeforBusiness_UserGuide_ConfigureSkypeforBusiness.html">Configue Skype for Business</MadCap:xref>.</p>
