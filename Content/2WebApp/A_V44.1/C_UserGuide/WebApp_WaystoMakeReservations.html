        <h1>Ways to Make Reservations</h1>
        <p>The EMS Web App provides&#160;several ways for you to make a new room request or event reservation:</p>
        <h2>1. Request a Reservation&#160;</h2>
        <p>If you&#160;<MadCap:xref href="WebApp_LogginginandOut.html">logged in</MadCap:xref>&#160;as a guest, you can submit a reservation request that will be approved by an authorized EMS Web App user.&#160;</p>
        <h2>2. Create a Reservation&#160;</h2>
        <p>Click&#160;<span class="bold">CREATE A RESERVATION</span>&#160;from the main menu. Then select a template to streamline the booking process and browse for available time&#160;slots and rooms.</p>
        <h2>3. Book Now Using Your Template&#160;</h2>
        <p>Click the&#160;<span class="bold">Book Now</span>&#160;button next to the template you prefer from your home page, and then&#160;browse for available time&#160;slots and rooms.</p>
        <h2>4. Browse and Then Book&#160;</h2>
        <p>Click&#160;<span class="bold">BROWSE&#160;</span>(main menu):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browse&#160;<span class="bold">EVENTS</span>.&#160;Then request a reservation or, if authorized,&#160;click&#160;CREATE A RESERVATION&#160;from the main menu and&#160;select a template to streamline the booking process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OR</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browse&#160;<span class="bold">LOCATIONS</span>, find the room you want,&#160;and click on&#160;any blank slot in the room's calendar. Then select a template to streamline the booking process.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>Tip: First Browse and Then Book. To familiarize yourself with the locations in your organization, try <MadCap:xref href="WebApp_BrowseEventsLocPeople.html">Browse Events, Locations, and People</MadCap:xref> before requesting rooms or making reservations. Exploring the EMS Web App this way helps you explore available space, view the schedule at a high level, and understand how other users in your organization reserve rooms. You can also establish your own naming conventions for your events and narrow down your searches to specific room types, room features, event types, geographical areas, and so on.</p>
        <p>Concepts: Booking Templates, Requests, and Reservations</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Templates:</span> Your My Account settings contain reservation Templates created by you or your Administrator to streamline the process of booking events. Rooms and workspaces are individually set to work with various types of booking templates by your Administrator.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Requests vs. Reservations:</span> Depending on your permissions, you may <span class="italics">Request </span>a Room or <span class="italics">Make </span>a Reservation. Room requests require approval from a more supervisory user, and are visible to other users so they know the space has been tentatively booked. The EMS Web App behaves differently for each type of user, showing fewer options (and usually, less information) for those who can only request rooms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What's the difference between a "reservation" and a "booking?"&#160;A&#160;<span class="italics">Reservation&#160;</span>consists&#160;of one&#160;or more&#160;<span class="italics">Bookings</span>.&#160;That's it.</p>
        <p>Every booking belongs to a reservation. EMS lets you have&#160;multiple bookings under a single reservation. When you have multiple bookings in a reservation, each booking&#160;can be independent of the other, such as reserving a set of rooms for an event, or can be a series of bookings under a&#160;<span class="bold">Recurring&#160;</span>reservation.</p>
        <p>Each booking can contain&#160;multiple&#160;<span class="bold">Booking Details</span>, which are the resources and services required to support the booking, such as catering and room setup.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Reservations: Who and What</h3>
        <p>A&#160;<span class="italics">reservation&#160;</span>is the "who and what" of an event. For example, the Academic Planning Board&#160;(the who) may reserve space for a Semester Kickoff&#160;event&#160;(the what).&#160;</p>
        <h3>Bookings: Where and When</h3>
        <p>A&#160;<span class="italics">booking&#160;</span>is the "where and when" of an event. For example, the Academic Planning Board schedules the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday in January (the when). The Academic Planning Board&#160;now has a single reservation with a single booking in EMS. If, however, they schedule&#160;the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday of each month for a year (the when), then the board now has a single reservation with 12 bookings.</p>
        <h4>Booking Details</h4>
        <p>A booking can have one or more booking details associated with it.&#160;<span class="italics">Booking details</span>&#160;are the resources (items for the meeting)&#160;or services (people and their activities)&#160;that are needed for an event, the notes for the event, the activities for the event, the room charges for the event, or any combination of these. For example, for the Academic Planning Board’s staff meeting, the resources could&#160;include catering (coffee service, bagels and muffins, and so on) and A/V equipment, plus the services of&#160;a person bringing in and setting up a projector, moving&#160;a speaker’s podium, and so on). &#160;</p>
        <h5>Service Orders</h5>
        <p>System Administrators configure "buckets" of these details as "Categories," which streamlines the process of adding details to bookings.&#160;</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Concept:&#160;Services, Categories, and Resources: What's the Difference?&#160;</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In EMS, you may hear these terms used&#160;interchangeably sometimes, however, they are different concepts.</p>
                <p>A&#160;<span class="italics">Category&#160;</span>in EMS is anything you might add to a Booking such as Catering, Audio Visual, Furniture, Security, Notes, Attendee Names, Agendas etc.&#160;When you configure a Category, however, it must be of six&#160;<span class="italics">Category&#160;types</span>:&#160;Activities, Attendees, Catering, Notes, Resources with Service Orders, or Resources Without Service Orders. These types cause the service to&#160;behave slightly differently when&#160;added to a booking. For example, a Notes/Activities/Attendees&#160;type service category&#160;does not require the EMS Administrator to configure items&#160;under it, and there is nothing for a person to “select” from these types of services.</p>
                <p>By contrast, a&#160;service category that has a type of&#160;Catering,&#160;Resource with Service Order, or a Resource without a&#160;Service Order Category,&#160;will require the Administrator to create items&#160;under it. For example, an&#160;"AV Equipment" service category (configured as a Resource without a Service Order Category type) might have items under it such as a flip chart or whiteboard (under AV Equipment).&#160;The person requesting the service for this meeting would then select&#160;<span class="bold">AV equipment</span>; then&#160;<span class="italics">flipchart&#160;</span>and&#160;<span class="italics">whiteboard&#160;</span>would be typical options to add to the event.&#160;</p>
                <p>Tip: The following Category Types allow <MadCap:xref href="../../../1DesktopClient/V44.1/B_ConfigGuide/DC_CG_DefineProdAreaItems.htm">Production Items</MadCap:xref>: Catering, Resources with Service Orders, and Resources Without Service Orders.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, a Category can&#160;be see configured&#160;to "Use States"&#160;so that when a service is requested with a meeting, it can be managed through a review and approval process in the Manage Services toolbar option&#160;in EMS Desktop Client.&#160;</p>
