        <h1>Locate People</h1>
        <p>You can click <span class="bold">BROWSE&#160;&gt; PEOPLE</span>&#160;from the main <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> menu to&#160;find events by the person who reserved or is attending the event or to simply find where a user or group will be located at a given time.&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: Previous releases of EMS called this "Locate a group."</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">To see&#160;all&#160;people and groups</span>&#160;who&#160;have events scheduled for today, leave the <span class="bold">Name </span>field blank&#160;and click <span class="bold">Search</span>.&#160;To narrow the results to only the bookings for one person or group, click on the user or group&#160;name.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">To search for a specific person or group</span>, enter at least the first three letters in the <span class="bold">Name </span>field (<MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> will suggest the closest match), and then click <span class="bold">Search</span>. &#160;&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: The Search field is not case-sensitive and you can search by first or last name.</p>
        <p>Tip: If your Administrator has enabled it, a Floor Plan icon will appear for each event in this view. You can click this icon to open a floor plan for the selected building and view location details.</p>
