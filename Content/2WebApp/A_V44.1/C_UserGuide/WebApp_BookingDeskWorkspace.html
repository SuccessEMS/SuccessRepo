            <li>You can begin making a reservation by clicking the <span class="bold">CREATE A RESERVATION</span> option (on the left menu) or the&#160;<span class="bold">Book&#160;Now</span> button next to one of your reservation templates (on the right).<p><img src="Images/WebApp_User/Booking a Desk or Workspace_2.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/6253/clipboard_eab6cb66cdadd8b4414cd9f75f54d3e30.png?revision=1" /></p></li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Specify When and Where&#160;</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>To specify&#160;<span class="italics">When</span>, select&#160;dates and&#160;times.<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If you wish to book space for multiple time slots, click the&#160;<span class="bold">Recurrence&#160;</span>button.<p><img src="Images/WebApp_User/Booking a Desk or Workspace_5.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/6020/bookingrecurrence.png?revision=1" /></p></li><li>Follow the prompts to select the frequency, date range, day of the week, start and end times, and time&#160;zone for the recurrence.<p><img src="Images/WebApp_User/Booking a Desk or Workspace_6.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/6019/bookingrecurrence2.png?revision=1" /></p></li><li>Click&#160;<span class="bold">Apply Recurrence</span> to validate your entries and return to the New Booking screen.<p>Tip:&#160;Once booked, each meeting will show as a single Booking in your My Bookings area on MY HOME.&#160;Also, note that the&#160;<span class="bold">Create Booking In</span>&#160;field specifies the time zone in which to book the meeting, which may differ from your system time zone.</p></li></ol></li>
            <li>To specify&#160;<span class="italics">Where</span>, in lower left panel, select one of the following:<ul start="1"><li><span class="bold">Let Me Search For A Room</span><p>OR</p></li><li><span class="bold">I Know What Room I Want</span>&#160;</li></ul><p>Tip: Filters in this lower left panel help you narrow your Search Results. When you click <span class="bold">Search</span>, results appear on the right. From these results, you can view expanded Room Details by clicking on the room name.</p><p>Locating space as part of the reservation process is different than simply browsing locations. For detailed instructions on using the BROWSE LOCATIONS option on the main menu to see available and booked space, see <MadCap:xref href="WebApp_BrowsingLocations.html">Browse Locations</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
            <li>Once you have located space&#160;to reserve, click the&#160;Add&#160;(+)&#160;icon to validate and add&#160;the booking to your cart. You can delete or change the room before you finalize&#160;your reservation.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Specify Who and What&#160;</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>In the Attendance area&#160;(near the center of the screen), select a&#160;<span class="bold">Setup Type</span>&#160;(if available)&#160;for the reservation&#160;from the dropdown.&#160;<p><img src="Images/WebApp_User/Booking a Desk or Workspace_10.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/6036/newressetupattendees.png?revision=1" /></p></li>
            <li>Specify headcount and attendees in the Attendance area. If you are the only attendee, you may be able to skip this step.<ul start="1"><li>If your organization has implemented EMS for&#160;Outlook, you use the optional Attendees section to&#160;add or remove attendees and send them invitations or notifications. Attendees can be individuals or mailing lists or groups. To see who is in a mailing list or group, simply expand it.&#160;This optional feature enables you to view attendees' availability and add or subtract them from the event.</li><li>If your organization has not implemented EMS for Outlook, you will see a list of EMS Web App users and groups but you will not see availability.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Once you have completed all required fields, click&#160;<span class="bold">Next&#160;Step</span> in the upper right corner.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Add Reservation Details&#160;</h3>
        <p>The Reservation Details screen finalizes information about your reservation. Invitations to bookings and attachments will be sent to any attendee you invites.&#160;The example shown below may differ from your implementation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To browse existing events from BROWSE EVENTS, click on an event name. This shows&#160;Event Details in a popup.<p><img src="Images/WebApp_User/Booking a Desk or Workspace_11.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/3880/eventdetailsaddtocalendar.png?revision=3" /></p></li>
            <li>Complete all required information and click&#160;<span class="bold">Save Reservation Details</span> and then&#160;click <span class="bold">Create Reservation</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip: To add the reservation to your Outlook calendar, click <span class="bold">Add Event To Calendar</span> at the bottom of the window.</p>
        <h3>EMS for Outlook® (Optional Capability)</h3>
        <p>Concept: EMS for Outlook® is an optional (extra cost) purchase. If your organization has purchased it, then you will see the EMS plugin icon in your Outlook application. You will also see additional features and functionality in EMS. Further, anywhere that you see people or groups in EMS, you will have access to everyone in your organization's email database (which is stored in Exchange Server). This means that you can see people's availability (Out of Office, Busy, In a Meeting, etc.), send them email invitations or notices, and add EMS events to your Outlook calendar.</p>
