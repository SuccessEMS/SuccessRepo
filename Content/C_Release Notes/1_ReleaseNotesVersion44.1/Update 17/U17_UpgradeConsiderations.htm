        <h1 class="Heading1_2">Upgrade Considerations V44.1</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Before upgrading, please read the important upgrade considerations below.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Important:&#160;EMS Software recommends a best practice of performing an Internet Information Services (IIS)&#160;reset for all Web applications after updates have been completed.</p>
        <h2>EMS Kiosk App</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">The Fall 2017 Release (V44.1, Update 17)&#160;contains extensive updates to the EMS Kiosk App. The EMS Kiosk App&#160;includes&#160;an enhanced&#160;user interface, as well as functionality that has simplified and expedited the booking process.&#160;Additionally, it is easier to project your brand.&#160;</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb">For more information regarding the updated functionality to the&#160;EMS Kiosk App, please see the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_Kiosk_V44.1" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_Kiosk_V44.1">EMS Kiosk App&#160;documentation</a>.</p>
        <h2>EMS for Outlook</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">The Fall 2017 Release (V44.1, Update 17)&#160;contains extensive updates to the EMS for Microsoft Outlook Add-in. The EMS for Outlook Add-in includes&#160;an enhanced&#160;user experience with service enhancements, simplified workflows, enhanced schedule view and attendee management, and support for visitor management. The updated EMS for Outlook Add-in&#160;also runs on&#160;EMS Platform Services.&#160;</p>
        <p class="note-box">Warning:&#160;To upgrade to Update 17 of EMS for Outlook, you will need to uninstall your legacy version&#160;and re-install.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb">For more information regarding the updated functionality to the&#160;EMS for Outlook Add-in, please see the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/?title=Installation_%26_Setup_Guides/EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook_V44.1" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/?title=Installation_%26_Setup_Guides/EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook_V44.1">EMS for Outlook Add-in</a>&#160;documentation.</p>
        <h2>EMS Desktop Client</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Versions 11 and later of the Web Deploy Desktop Client will be required to upgrade to Update 14. This is due to a failure of the Web deploy to automatically update.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Warning:&#160;Do not try to manually update the Web Deploy using the AutoUpdate.exe. You will receive an error, "EMS is having trouble connecting," and the Desktop Client will stop working completely.&#160;</p>
        <h2>EMS Room Sign App (formerly Glance)&#160;</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">As of Update 12, significant changes were made to&#160;the former EMS Glance product. The Update renames Glance to the EMS Room Sign App and also greatly updates the visual design.&#160;You may have to manually refresh the Room Sign App page on each tablet following your upgrade. To refresh the page on an iPad, you should close the browser and &#160;re-open it using the homelink. We are working to ensure you will not have to do so in the future.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Upgrading to any release after Update 7 was causing end users to see an error message on the tablet. The browser on each tablet had to be restarted to eliminate the error.&#160;After upgrading to Update 15, end users will no longer see the error message.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Tip:&#160;This fix is possible because Update 15 initially turns off the any anti-forgery validation. To turn on this validation (and thus close the security hole), follow these upgrade steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_10">Uninstall your current Room Sign application.</li>
            <li class="li_10">Install Update 15 to the exact same virtual directory.</li>
            <li class="li_4">After successfully installing, go into the EMS Desktop Client and&#160;Refresh All Units.<br></br><img src="../../../Resources/Images/V44.1 Release page/Before Upgrading Please Read_7.jpg" alt="RoomSignApp_RefreshAllClients.JPG" class="img_1"></img></li>
            <li class="li_10">Wait a few minutes for all the units to obtain the new settings.&#160;</li>
            <li class="li_4">Edit the Room Sign web.config file, and search for&#160; &lt;add key="ValidateAntiForgery" value="false" /&gt;.</li>
            <li class="li_10">Change “false” to “true.”</li>
            <li class="li_10">Save and close the file.</li>
            <li class="li_10">Refresh all profiles.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>EMS Mobile App&#160;</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">EMS Mobile App Update 12 is compatible with Platform Services Update 12, as well as previous versions.&#160;Platform Services Update 12 is NOT compatible with previous versions of EMS Mobile App. Customers upgrading to Platform Services Update 12 must upgrade to EMS Mobile App Update 12.</p>
