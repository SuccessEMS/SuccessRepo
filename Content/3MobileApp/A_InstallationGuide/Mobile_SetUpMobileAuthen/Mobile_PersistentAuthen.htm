        <h1>Persistent Authentication</h1>
        <p>Persistent Authentication&#160;refers to the EMS Mobile App's&#160;ability to automatically log users in so that they are not required to log into EMS Mobile App&#160;every time they need to access it. &#160;When using persistent authentication, a user's EMS Mobile App credentials will become invalid after a&#160;period of inactivity&#160;equal to or greater than the duration defined in settings.&#160;If not using persistent authentication, a user will be forced to re-authenticate after the duration defined in settings has elapsed, regardless of activity.</p>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Users with persistent authentication will be prompted to log back in to EMS Mobile App&#160;if anything is changed about their profile in EMS Desktop Client on the&#160;<MadCap:xref href="../../../1DesktopClient/V44.1/B_ConfigGuide/DC_CG_ConfigEverydayUser.htm">Everyday Users tab</MadCap:xref>, such as&#160;Email, Password, External Reference, Network ID, and&#160;Security Template. If your remove a user's access to a process template, they will also be alerted when they attempt to use it, and then they will be&#160;prompted to re-authenticate.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the&#160;Admin Functions&#160;page, which is listed under your name in the upper right corner of the application.</li>
            <li>Tap the&#160;<span class="bold">Mobile App</span>&#160;tab.<br /></li>
            <li>Select the&#160;<span class="bold">Persistent Authentication</span>&#160;option.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Set the token duration in Mins/Days and&#160;<span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;This setting&#160;overrides the token duration sent by SSO providers.</p>
        <p>Note:&#160;If a user should leave your organization, you should manually disable&#160;his or her profile in EMS, otherwise the employee will have access to EMS Mobile App&#160;for the duration defined above. You can also use&#160;<MadCap:xref href="../../../F_Optional Features/HRToolkit/A_V44.1/HRToolkit_InstallationOverview.htm">HR Toolkit</MadCap:xref>&#160;to streamline this process.&#160;</p>
