        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_14">EMS provides more than 110 reports and a custom query builder for use throughout the meeting and event lifecycle—from setup and invoicing to billing and utilization analysis. These&#160;"one-way integration" reports generate static reservation, service, billing, resource, and other information in .xml, .xls, comma-delimited, and&#160;.txt formats. This data&#160;can be read and parsed by many other&#160;software applications. These reports are categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul class="ul_5">
            <li class="li_8">Daily:&#160;Summary, service, and other reports that describe activities over one or more days.</li>
            <li class="li_8">Sales:&#160;Details of sales associated with reservations, resources, and more.</li>
            <li class="li_8">Statistics:&#160;Insights you need to understand use and organizational activity.</li>
            <li class="li_8">Exception:&#160;Clarifies the incorrectly run or allocated resources, templates, or systems.</li>
            <li class="li_8">Billing:&#160;All reports for transactions, invoices, and other statements.</li>
            <li class="li_8">Hoteling:&#160;Reports specific to office hoteling practices and QR codes for room cards.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="NormalWeb_14">You can send reports according to whatever frequency, time, time zone, and reporting period you choose, and you can customize the sender, subject, and message information. To set up Automated Reports, your organization will need to install and configure the EMS Automated Report service.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3_1">QR Codes</h3>
        <p class="mtindent2_1">You can associate rooms with QR Codes: EMS Desktop Client provides a report that&#160;generates the codes and associates them with the designated rooms.

        <p class="NormalWeb_11">EMS integration with Active Directory (AD / LDAP) lets your organization use your HR data, such as existing user records and accounts, as the sign-in credentials for EMS.

        <h2 class="Heading2_1">HVAC</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">Unused space often has heating, cooling, and other utilities continually running — equating to a large, unnecessary expense. Compliant with green initiatives and LEED certification,&#160;EMS API and Facilities Management Toolkit&#160;help&#160;organizations reduce costs: they can be configured to&#160;integrate&#160;with third-party&#160;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems (such as EVENTS2HVAC™&#160;by Streamside Solutions)&#160;to automate heating and cooling based on room usage.</p>
