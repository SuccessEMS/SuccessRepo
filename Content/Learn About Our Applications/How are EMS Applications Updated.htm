        </ul>
        <p class="NormalWeb_11"><span class="span_2">Each has its own installation and upgrade procedure. You can download the EMS License Key, Server Install, and updates for all components at the&#160;</span><a href="http://www.dea.com/ServiceAndSupport/productdownloads.aspx" title="http://www.dea.com/ServiceAndSupport/productdownloads.aspx"><span class="Hyperlink_2">Downloads Portal&#160;</span></a><span class="span_2">(once you are logged in).

An update may not affect all components, so for example, Update 1 affected the EMS Database, the Desktop Client, Exchange, and EMS for Outlook, but&#160;Update 2 only affected the Desktop Client and EMS for Outlook. Updates are cumulative, which means that&#160;to bring one of your affected components&#160;up to the most current version, you can skip any older updates that you </span><span class="span_3">missed and only install the latest update. For example, to update your EMS for Outlook from V44.1 all the way up to Update 2, you only need to install Update 2 for EMS for Outlook. That single install includes all updates from Update 1 and Update&#160;2.</span>
