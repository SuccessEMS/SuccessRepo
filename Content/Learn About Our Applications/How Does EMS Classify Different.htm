        <h1 class="Heading1">How Does EMS Classify Different Types of Users?</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Types of Users in EMS</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Overall, users are divided into two groups:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="Strong_2">Everyday&#160;Users</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_19">...such as meeting and event coordinators and organizers, calendar managers,&#160;meeting participants and hosts, space planners and usage auditors.</p>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_2">
            <li class="Strong_2">Expert Users (Admins and Managers)</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_19">...such as IT professionals who install and maintain the software, servers, and databases, oversight specialists who set up booking templates, define buildings, areas, rooms, default values, custom fields, etc.,&#160;and permissions gatekeepers who grant users access to EMS.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Note:&#160;Since your installation of EMS can be highly customized, field names referring to users may not be the same as those explained here. For example, your system may call Attendees "Visitors" or Contacts "Organizers." This topic explains the user types as-delivered before customization.&#160;</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3_1">Types of Everyday&#160;Users</h3>
        <p class="p_20">Within the pool of end-users, there are&#160;additional user types.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Guests&#160;</span>or&#160;<span class="bold">Visitors&#160;</span>or&#160;<span class="bold">Unauthenticated Users</span>&#160;(users who do not have to log in to request meeting space; System Administrators can enable them to browse a calendar of events or view details about your organization’s space).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">General Users</span>&#160;(individuals who log in to EMS Desktop Client and other EMS products and have booking templates, permissions templates, and other privileges assigned to them by Administrators).<br />Approvers&#160;(individuals oversee and approve event, space, and service requests in a request/approve model, typical of organizations with "managed space.")</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Web Users</span>&#160;or&#160;<span class="bold">Everyday Users</span>&#160;(individuals who have log in access to the web-based EMS applications: EMS Web App, VEMS, and EMS Mobile App.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Everyday User Roles in EMS</h2>
