        <p class="NormalWeb_14">EMS more than 110 reports and a custom query builder for use throughout the meeting and event lifecycle—from setup and invoicing to billing and utilization analysis. These&#160;"one-way integration" reports generate static reservation, service, billing, resource, and other information in .xml, .xls, comma-delimited, and&#160;.txt formats. This data&#160;can be read and parsed by many other&#160;software applications. These reports are categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul class="ul_5">
            <li class="li_8"><span class="mt-color-669933_1">Daily</span><span class="span_2">:&#160;Summary, service, and other reports that describe activities over one or more days.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="li_8"><span class="mt-color-669933_1">Sales</span><span class="span_2">:&#160;Details of sales associated with reservations, resources, and more.</span>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li class="li_8"><span class="mt-color-669933_1">Billing</span><span class="span_2">:&#160;All reports for transactions, invoices, and other statements.</span>

        <p class="NormalWeb_14">The reports that you can send automatically include Reservation and Sales/Statistics Queries and all Saved Daily and Statistics Reports. You can send reports according to whatever frequency, time, time zone, and reporting period you choose, and you can customize the sender, subject, and message information.
