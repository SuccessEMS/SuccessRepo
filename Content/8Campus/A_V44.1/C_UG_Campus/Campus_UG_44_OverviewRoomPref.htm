        <h1 class="Heading1">Review and Verify Room Preferences</h1>
        <p>Set Preferences is an optional mode in which the Domain Scheduler can solicit preferences from academic units about the type of rooms that would be suitable for each course that they teach. These preferences can then be used to run an optimization, or to have EMS automate room scheduling based on preferences and additional user-specified criteria. To enable and use Set Preferences Mode, the following steps are carried out:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The Domain Scheduler enables Set Preferences mode. See&#160;<span class="span_1">“</span><a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/Enabling_and_Disabling_a_Term_for_Set_Preferences_Mode" title="Enabling/Disabling a Term for Set Preferences Mode"><span class="Hyperlink_1">Enabling/Disabling a Term for Set Preferences Mode</span></a><span class="span_1">”.</span></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">The academic units review courses and specify their room preferences and requirements using the EMS Campus Planning Interface (typical) or the EMS Academic Planning desktop client (if granted access). See&#160;<span class="span_1">“</span><a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/120-Specifying_Room_Preferences%2F%2FRequirements" title="Specifying Room Preferences/Requirements"><span class="Hyperlink_1">Specifying Room Preferences/Requirements</span></a><span class="span_1">”.</span></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">The Domain Scheduler verifies and reviews the room preferences and requirements that the academic units have specified. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After room preferences and requirements are set, you can review&#160;the individual course preferences, verify that the preferences are complete, and quantify these preferences. You can also run the Course Preferences report and the Course Preferences Summary report to assist in this task.</p>
        <p>Tips:&#160;For detailed information about generating the Course Preferences and Course Preferences Summary reports and the information that is contained in each report, see&#160;<MadCap:xref href="33AcadPlan_UG_GenerateAcadReports.htm">Generating Academic Reports.</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Prior to reviewing or reporting on preferences, you can make the term unavailable to the academic units. See&#160;<MadCap:xref href="34AcadPlan_UG_EnableDisableTermSetPrefMode.htm">Enabling and Disabling a Term for Set Preferences Mode</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">

        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph">On the Domain dropdown list, select the appropriate domain and on the Term dropdown list, select the appropriate term.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Set any other criteria (academic unit, subject, and so on) as needed to provide assistance in locating the courses for which you want to review preferences and requirements, and then click Get Data.&#160;The courses that meet your search criteria are displayed on the Results tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;To identify preferences and requirements for a Basic search, you should set Preferences Exist to Yes. For an Advanced search, you should select the Preferences Exist field (a Course Dates level field), and set the Preferences Exist filter to Yes. For detailed information about searching with the Academic Browser, see&#160;<MadCap:xref href="28AcadPlan_UG_SearchwithAcadBrowser.htm">Searching with the Academic Browser</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol start="5" class="ol_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph">In the search results, double-click the course for which you are reviewing the preferences/requirements.&#160;The course opens in the Course Navigator.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">In the middle pane of the Course Navigator, select the course date for which you are reviewing the preferences.&#160;The preferences for the selected course date are displayed in the bottom pane of the Course Navigator on the Preferences tab.</li>
